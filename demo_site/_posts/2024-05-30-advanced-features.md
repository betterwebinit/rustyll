Explore Rustyll's advanced features for building complex, data-driven static sites.

## Collections

Collections allow you to group related content:

```yaml
# _config.yml
collections:
  products:
    output: true
    permalink: /products/:name/
  team:
    output: false
```

Create content in `_products/` and access it via `site.products`.

## Data Files

Store structured data in `_data/` directory:

```yaml
# _data/navigation.yml
- name: "Home"
  url: "/"
- name: "About"
  url: "/about/"
```

Access in templates: `{% raw %}{% for item in site.data.navigation %}{% endraw %}`

## Plugin System

Rustyll supports both built-in and custom plugins:

```toml
# Cargo.toml
[dependencies]
rustyll-plugin-search = "0.1"
rustyll-plugin-analytics = "0.2"
```

## Advanced Liquid Features

### Custom Filters

```liquid
{% raw %}{{ content | truncatewords: 50 }}
{{ "/assets/image.jpg" | absolute_url }}{% endraw %}
```

### Custom Tags

```liquid
{% raw %}{% gallery "vacation-photos" %}
{% chart "sales-data.json" %}{% endraw %}
```
