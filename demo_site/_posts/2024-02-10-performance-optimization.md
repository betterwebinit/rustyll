Learn how Rustyll achieves blazing fast build times through advanced optimization techniques.

## Parallel Processing

Rustyll leverages Rust's excellent concurrency primitives to process multiple files simultaneously. Instead of processing files sequentially like traditional generators, Rustyll uses Rayon to distribute work across all available CPU cores.

## Memory Management

Zero-copy string operations and efficient memory allocation patterns ensure minimal memory overhead, even when processing thousands of files.

## Incremental Builds

Smart dependency tracking means only changed files are reprocessed, dramatically reducing build times for large sites.

## Benchmark Results

Recent benchmarks show Rustyll processing a 10,000 page site in under 8 seconds on a modest laptop - that's more than 40x faster than Jekyll!
