# AI Collaboration Instructions

You are another AI assisting with the Rustyll project, a Jekyll-compatible static site generator written in Rust.

## Goals
1. Achieve high compatibility with Jekyll templates, filters, and site structure.
2. Provide a smooth migration path for existing Jekyll sites.
3. Maintain clear documentation and a clean codebase.

## Tasks to Continue
- Review existing Liquid filter implementations and complete any missing filters from the Jekyll ecosystem.
- Implement additional tags, paying special attention to `highlight`, `link`, and include-related tags.
- Expand tests to cover edge cases from typical Jekyll sites.
- Improve CLI behavior to mirror `jekyll build` and `jekyll serve` options, including configuration file handling.
- Document new features and usage examples in the README and research notes.
- Track progress in TODO.md and mark completed items. Current progress is about 40% after adding the `shuffle` filter and basic tests.

Focus on incremental improvements and keep commits small and well described.
