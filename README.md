## Philosophy

Rustyll was born from the belief that static site generation should be:

- **Fast without compromise**: Build times should be measured in milliseconds, not minutes.
- **Familiar yet powerful**: Compatible with existing Jekyll sites while offering powerful new capabilities.
- **Extensible by design**: A plugin system that makes it easy to extend functionality.
- **Modern and future-proof**: Built with modern Rust for reliability, security, and performance.
- **Developer-friendly**: Clear error messages, comprehensive documentation, and sensible defaults.

As part of the **Better Web Initiative**, we're committed to making the web faster, more accessible, and more sustainable. We believe that by building tools that respect these principles, we can contribute to a web that works better for everyone.

## Why Rustyll?

Rustyll combines the best of both worlds: the familiar Jekyll ecosystem with the performance and safety of Rust. Whether you're migrating an existing Jekyll site or starting fresh, Rustyll offers significant advantages:

- **Dramatically faster builds** - Sites build 10-100x faster than with Ruby-based Jekyll
- **Memory efficient** - Build even the largest sites with minimal RAM requirements
- **Improved security** - Benefit from Rust's memory safety and security guarantees
- **Modern features** - Advanced asset pipelines, better incremental builds, and more
- **Jekyll compatibility** - Use existing Jekyll themes and plugins with minimal changes

| Jekyll        | 25.3s      | 320 MB       |
| Hugo          | 1.2s       | 65 MB        |
| Eleventy      | 8.5s       | 180 MB       |
| Next.js (SSG) | 12.1s      | 350 MB       |
