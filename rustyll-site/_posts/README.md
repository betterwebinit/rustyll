# Posts Directory

This directory contains all your blog posts migrated from Jekyll.

## Post Format

Posts in Rustyll follow a similar format to Jekyll:
- Files are named with the format `YYYY-MM-DD-title.md`
- Front matter is at the top of the file, enclosed in `---`
- Content follows the front matter

## Changes from Jekyll

- Some front matter variables might have different names in Rustyll
- Liquid tag syntax might be slightly different
